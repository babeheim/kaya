holynec [?\]: ok, but what is your assessment of the board right now
atticus [7k\]: white has some territory
holynec [?\]: are you happy with the exchanges you made
atticus [7k\]: yes
atticus [7k\]: at least i don't know how to get more
holynec [?\]: what about your black group
holynec [?\]: on the right
atticus [7k\]: top right?
holynec [?\]: yes
atticus [7k\]: hmm
atticus [7k\]: that white stone could cause trouble
atticus [7k\]: especially with r9 there
atticus [7k\]: i wouldn't say this is a base
holynec [?\]: ok
holynec [?\]: so
holynec [?\]: lets compare top right and bottom right
atticus [7k\]: ok
holynec [?\]: did someone get more
holynec [?\]: ?
atticus [7k\]: white did
holynec [?\]: really?!
atticus [7k\]: even in an even game i'd say
atticus [7k\]: not even including the handi stones
holynec [?\]: white did get more :p
holynec [?\]: even in this game white got more
holynec [?\]: ok
holynec [?\]: so bottom right
holynec [?\]: normal joseki yes?
atticus [7k\]: with the handi stones its criminal how much white got
atticus [7k\]: ya
holynec [?\]: top right
holynec [?\]: normal joseki
holynec [?\]: ?
atticus [7k\]: well it depends on the whole-board position
holynec [?\]: how about this A stone
atticus [7k\]: it isn't part of the joseki
atticus [7k\]: its not really doing anything
atticus [7k\]: right now
holynec [?\]: it feels a little overconcentrated

atticus [7k\]: and sorta just guessed where
atticus [7k\]: should i be worried about the difference between here and star point?
atticus [7k\]: at least as a SDK?
holynec [?\]: ok
atticus [7k\]: or here and 3rd line?
holynec [?\]: so 1) are there any urgent moves
holynec [?\]: or spots
atticus [7k\]: right
holynec [?\]: what is urgent
atticus [7k\]: urgent means groups that will get in trouble if i neglect them
atticus [7k\]: to me
atticus [7k\]: i think nothing
atticus [7k\]: time to play big moves
holynec [?\]: ok
holynec [?\]: so are there groups that will get into trouble
holynec [?\]: ?
holynec [?\]: if you neglect them
holynec [?\]: and by trouble which means, attacked severely
holynec [?\]: or pushed around a lot
atticus [7k\]: in 1 move? i say no
holynec [?\]: ok, so no urgent groups
holynec [?\]: so what the big areas
atticus [7k\]: the sides
atticus [7k\]: and the corner i get two moves in
holynec [?\]: ok so what is more open
holynec [?\]: ? >:}
atticus [7k\]: sorry what's open mean?
holynec [?\]: widest space
atticus [7k\]: oh
holynec [?\]: usually means biggest move
atticus [7k\]: D10
holynec [?\]: exactly 
holynec [?\]: that is the side you should play on
atticus [7k\]: oh!
holynec [?\]: the widest side
atticus [7k\]: wow
holynec [?\]: it is hard to play top
holynec [?\]: because white is already strong there
holynec [?\]: cant make territory easily there
atticus [7k\]: i see
holynec [?\]: so a move like j16 does not make so muche sense
holynec [?\]: white is already low
holynec [?\]: the left side is the "correct direction of play"
holynec [?\]: :p
atticus [7k\]: cool
holynec [?\]: you see how j16 isnt as efficient
holynec [?\]: as a move on the left

holynec [?\]: 2nd mistake
atticus [7k\]: uh huh
];W[cj]WL[1634.16]C[holynec [?\]: you need to feel/understand the difference between j16 and the left side

(;B[jd]TR[oh]C[atticus [7k\]: i was thinking about this....
atticus [7k\]: this marked stone isn't in the joseki but is close to what you want
atticus [7k\]: the original pincer isn't as surrounded
atticus [7k\]: i dunno, just decided to go with something more familiar tho
holynec [?\]: well what if you played q14 here instead of k16
atticus [7k\]: i see

atticus [7k\]: seems pretty good

atticus [7k\]: ya that's the one
atticus [7k\]: exaclty
holynec [?\]: so what are the conditions on choosing this joseki
holynec [?\]: ?
atticus [7k\]: A needs to be under black's control
atticus [7k\]: or abouts
holynec [?\]: how come
atticus [7k\]: if white's there
atticus [7k\]: then black is a wall between two stable white groups
atticus [7k\]: not useful
holynec [?\]: ok
holynec [?\]: what if white isnt there
holynec [?\]: ?
holynec [?\]: like here
atticus [7k\]: white would play there next i suppose
holynec [?\]: ok
atticus [7k\]: or maybe 1 lower
holynec [?\]: and what would that do to the wall
atticus [7k\]: well since white can make a 2-space jump etiher way
atticus [7k\]: i'd say it would neutralize it
holynec [?\]: yeah, makes it useless
atticus [7k\]: b/c white''s stabilized
holynec [?\]: so who's move is it after this joseki
atticus [7k\]: white's
holynec [?\]: yes!
holynec [?\]: that is why you need a stone around A
holynec [?\]: if you choose this direction
atticus [7k\]: right
holynec [?\]: because black ends in gote
holynec [?\]: and does not have time to play that extension
atticus [7k\]: ya
atticus [7k\]: i didn't play it
holynec [?\]: otherwise white neutralizes
atticus [7k\]: then i'd play k16 
];W[jd])
(;B[dn]C[holynec [?\]: this is also another way
holynec [?\]: for the joseki
atticus [7k\]: but i was wondering if the stone at p12 sort of helped me get sente in the joseki
holynec [?\]: yeah, but it is still very thin
holynec [?\]: hm
holynec [?\]: this is a variation on the joseki

(;B[cp]C[atticus [7k\]: ya i figured something bad would happened if i went that far off
holynec [?\]: now what happens by blocking this direction?
atticus [7k\]: this is better for black
atticus [7k\]: the wall faces the right way
holynec [?\]: ok, but who ends with sente
holynec [?\]: ?
atticus [7k\]: black does
holynec [?\]: yes
atticus [7k\]: so its double-better
holynec [?\]: key difference between blocking this way
holynec [?\]: and the other

atticus [7k\]: that's the reason
atticus [7k\]: ah!
holynec [?\]: the reason why bottom left is bad
atticus [7k\]: ok so i should consider a different punishment
holynec [?\]: is literally just 1 liberty
holynec [?\]: yeah
holynec [?\]: you can punish better here
holynec [?\]: this exchange of A for B is bad

;W[cf]LB[ce:1][eq:A][er:B]TR[ch][hq]C[holynec [?\]: because in normal joseki black doesnt do A for B
holynec [?\]: it is a bad exchange for black
holynec [?\]: he loses 1 liberty
atticus [7k\]: right
atticus [7k\]: so that's why tis good for white right
holynec [?\]: but bottom right is better punishment
atticus [7k\]: aji keshi
holynec [?\]: yeah
holynec [?\]: aji keshi
holynec [?\]: + removing own liberty
atticus [7k\]: ah see
atticus [7k\]: i see
holynec [?\]: aji keshi
holynec [?\]: is the the move at the triangle 
holynec [?\]: black loses the triangle move too
atticus [7k\]: ya i know that one
atticus [7k\]: that was what i was aiming for with that misplay
holynec [?\]: yep, let me rephrase
holynec [?\]: 1 liberty + aji keshi
atticus [7k\]: nice
atticus [7k\]: ok gotta go
holynec [?\]: but bottom right is more preferable
