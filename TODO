- some invalid SGF's still aren't being spotted - clean them!

- look at journal entry 2018-11-13 - Kaya vignettes, and compare with the vignettes/ folder

- there has to be a way to incorporate the whole update_status function in write_tiny_gif.R, so we dont have to rerun the same calculations over and over again?

- does id_direct_connections handle NA's correctly?

- orient_sgf: how to handle passes? convert to NA? seperate this step into its own function?

- lapply_pb, is this strictly necessary? is my version in longformer better?

- what functions are unusued? what aren't being tested?

- looks like i'm not using the invalid_sgf folder as effectively as i could be in read_sgf! warnings and errors...

- test_parse_sgf gives it all the different strings i can think of
- read_sgf's rotation test...wait! it's simplfy_game's orientation test, called by read_sgf...but did i write the test correctly? 

- whats the diff between `validate_sgf` and `validate_games`?

- if 'update_status' expects a group_id, then why doesn't read_sgf assign one? and, does it have to be rando?

- i don't think sgf_to_json should be part of kaya itself...more like a batch processing script...

- write tests for write_sgf, write then validate!
- write tests for write_gif and write_tiny_gif!

- test simplify_game directly somehow...also its helper functions!

- what if simplify_game calls update_status and will report if something's wrong!
